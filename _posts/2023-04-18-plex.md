System Update

```shell
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

## Install Dependencies


```shell
sudo apt install apt-transport-https curl wget -y
```

## Install Plex Repository

In this step, we will add plex repository to our system

```shell
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/plex.gpg] https://downloads.plex.tv/repo/deb public main | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/plexmediaserver.list
```

In the next step, we will execute the below-given “wget” command for importing the GPG key to our Ubuntu 22.04 system:

```shell
sudo wget -O- https://downloads.plex.tv/plex-keys/PlexSign.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/plex.gpg
```

Now, move towards the next step.

## Install Plex

```shell
sudo apt install plexmediaserver -y
```

## Make sure it running

Once installed, the software will run automatically, therefore if you wish to see its status then run this command.

```shell
sudo systemctl status plexmediaserver
```
Should see active once you run the command if it is not started run the command below

```shell
sudo systemctl start plexmediaserver
```

Also, you have to enable this software to begin automatically on system boot, if you want.

```shell
sudo systemctl enable plexmediaserver
```

## Enable Firewall

If you have an active firewall, then you need to enable it by opening port 32400 through the firewall using this command

```shell
sudo ufw allow 32400
```
## Configure Plex

Now, go to your browser and type http://localhost:32400/web.
