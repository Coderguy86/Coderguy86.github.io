The MS-900 exam, also known as "Microsoft 365 Fundamentals," is designed for individuals looking to demonstrate foundational knowledge of Microsoft 365 services and concepts. Here's a brief summary of its key components:

Cloud Concepts: Understanding cloud computing principles, types of cloud services (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and the benefits of using cloud solutions.

Core Microsoft 365 Services: Overview of Microsoft 365 offerings, including services like Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, and Teams.

Security, Compliance, and Privacy: Familiarity with Microsoft 365 security features, compliance tools, and privacy principles, including identity protection and information governance.

Microsoft 365 Pricing and Support: Knowledge of subscription plans, billing, and support options available for Microsoft 365 customers.

Deployment and Management: Understanding the basics of deployment models and managing Microsoft 365 environments.
