## This is just a post to myself to document my homelab in progress!

## Starting from the bottom my nas of choice is Truenas Scale. I've been using truenas for years and it never let me down so far.

## Next one up is my Proxmox!!! My choice of type 1 hypervisor. I've used other type 1 hypervisor in the past like ESXi and  XCP-ng but I always go back to proxmox.

## Above my proxmox box. I run PfSense. I could talk about PFSense for days. My favorite  open source router/firewall. I may redo my network in the near future but so far it been working out great!

## Next we have my Juniper 4200ex switch. Very noisy, will switch out to something alittle less noisy. My homelab  definitely need a proper make over.
