Terraform and Ansible are both popular open-source tools used for infrastructure automation, but they serve different purposes.

Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It uses a declarative language to describe the desired state of infrastructure resources and can be used to manage infrastructure across multiple cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and even third-party services. Terraform automates the process of provisioning, scaling, and managing infrastructure resources, and it can be integrated with popular DevOps tools like Jenkins, Git, and AWS CodePipeline.

Ansible, on the other hand, is a tool for automating IT tasks such as configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Ansible uses a simple, human-readable language to describe the desired state of systems and can be used to manage both local and remote systems, making it an ideal choice for managing infrastructure at scale. Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any software to be installed on the managed nodes, making it easy to deploy and manage.

In summary, while Terraform is focused on managing infrastructure resources, Ansible is focused on automating tasks and configuration management. Both tools can be used together to create a comprehensive infrastructure automation solution.

# Install Terraform on Ubuntu/Debian

```shell
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

```

# Installing the lastest version of Ansible

Most distributions have an older version of Ansible installed. This is usually fine except sometimes you may need to use features from the latest Ansible. Use the following commands to update Ansible to the latest version.

Check version

```shell
ansible --version
```
If itâ€™s not the version you are looking for, check to see where it is installed

```console
which ansible
```
If it lives somewhere like

```shell
/usr/bin/ansible
```

This is most likely due to your distribution installing it there.

Remove previous version

```shell
sudo apt remove ansible
```

Check to be sure it has been removed

```shell
which ansible
```
You should see if you have  pip install

```shell
python3 -m pip -V
```
If not run the command

```shell
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Install ansible

```shell
python3 -m pip install --user ansible
```

Confirm your version with

```shell
ansible --version
```
# Clone repo & Cd into vm for virtual machine or ct for a (container)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Coderguy86/proxmox-automation.git
cd proxmox-automation/tf/vm
```

 Configure the variables in var.tf.

 ```hcl
 variable "proxmox_host" {
	type = map
     default = {
       pm_api_url = "https://10.0.42.50:8006/api2/json"
       pm_user = "root@pam"
       target_node = "pve"
     }
}

variable "vmid" {
	default     = 400
	description = "Starting ID for the CTs"
}


variable "hostnames" {
  description = "VMs to be created"
  type        = list(string)
  default     = ["prod-vm", "staging-vm", "dev-vm"]
}

variable "rootfs_size" {
	default = "2G"
}

variable "ips" {
    description = "IPs of the VMs, respective to the hostname order"
    type        = list(string)
	default     = ["10.0.42.80", "10.0.42.81", "10.0.42.82"]
}

variable "ssh_keys" {
	type = map
     default = {
       pub  = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519-pwless.pub"
       priv = "~/.ssh/id_ed25519-pwless"
     }
}

variable "ssh_password" {}

variable "user" {
	default     = "notroot"
	description = "User used to SSH into the machine and provision it"
}
```
# Create SSH keys if you don't have any

No passphrase when creating SSH keys. I've notice atleast for me ansible doesn't play nice with passphrase's.

```shell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```

# Add your public keys to authorized_keys

```shell
cd ../../ # to go back two directories if started from proxmox-automation/tf/vm
cd ansible/files
```

# Edit anything you see  with "notroot" with your creds in provision.yaml

```hcl

# Create a cloud-init VM template in proxmox

Create a template VM (in this case Ubuntu 22.04)

```shell
wget "https://cloud-images.ubuntu.com/releases/22.04/release/ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img"
export VM_ID="9000"
qm create 9000 --memory 2048 --net0 virtio,bridge=vmbr0 --sockets 1 --cores 2 --vcpu 2  -hotplug network,disk,cpu,memory --agent 1 --name cloud-init-jammy --ostype l26
qm importdisk $VM_ID ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img local-lvm
qm set $VM_ID --scsihw virtio-scsi-pci --virtio0 local-lvm:vm-$VM_ID-disk-0
qm set $VM_ID --ide2 local-lvm:cloudinit
qm set $VM_ID --boot c --bootdisk virtio0
qm set $VM_ID --serial0 socket
qm template $VM_ID
rm ubuntu-22.04-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
```

Depending on which distro you choose you will also have to go back and edit main.tf



# Ready to Rock!

Enter in the following commands to initlize terraform

```shell
export PM_PASS='your-PVE-password'
```
This should pull in the Terraform Proxmox provider and configure the Terraform project

```shell
terraform init
```

```shell
terraform plan -out plan
```

```shell
terraform apply
```
